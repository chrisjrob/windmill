Description
-----------
Designed in OpenSCAD.
Simple design for a windmill. 

Status
------
Complete, but it was only ever intended to be a basic model.

Instructions
------------
* Edit SCAD file with the your chosen parameters
* Compile and export to STL
* Alternatively download one of the included STLs:
  - [windmill\_tower.stl](https://github.com/chrisjrob/windmill/blob/master/windmill_tower.stl "Windmill Tower") : Just the tower
  - [windmill\_sails.stl](https://github.com/chrisjrob/windmill/blob/master/windmill_sails.stl "Windmill sails") : Just the sails
  - [windmill\_print.stl](https://github.com/chrisjrob/windmill/blob/master/windmill_print.stl "Windmill print") : Both tower and sails in one print
  - [windmill.stl](https://github.com/chrisjrob/windmill/blob/master/windmill.stl "Windmill Demo - Not for Printing") : Demo only - not for printing
* Slice (might be worth adding a raft) and print
